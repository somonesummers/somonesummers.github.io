### Digital Diary from Antarctica 2021-2022

This is a collection of the email updates I sent back to family along my trip. The formatting from email to my website wasnâ€™t perfect, but I've tried to keep it neat. Each update is labeled by the date I sent it. 

## September 27 2021

Hello Everyone!

(I took this email list from the last family email I could find, please fwd to anyone I forgot!)

I'm excited to say that everything seems to have fallen into place and I'll be headed to Antarctica this winter! I wanted to let you all know my timeline in case you are curious and mention how to get in contact with me if you'd like.

Quarantine in SF Oct 5-10 with internet/cell coverage.
Quarantine in NZ Oct 10-Oct 25(ish) with internet/cell coverage (but long distance fees)
McMurdo base Oct 26(ish)-Nov 20(ish)  with extremely limited internet, no cell coverage.
Deep Field Nov 21(ish) - Jan 26th(ish) with no internet, no cell coverage.
McMurdo base Jan 27th - Feb 1(ish) with extremely limited internet, no cell coverage.
NZ-SFO homeward bound Feb 1(ish) - Feb 14(ish) with internet/cell coverage.

I'll try to send some email updates if you're curious to follow me around. I'll try not to be too spammy I promise. In SF/NZ I will have normal internet access and can ZOOM/Skype/email/etc. In McMurdo I will only be able to do text only emails, and my access to the internet is limited to certain hours of the day. 

When I'm out of internet coverage, I will update my InReach device periodically, which you can see here:

If you go there now you'll see updates from my other trips, but you'll start to see updates from Antarctica soon enough. You should be able to send me text only messages here as well if you'd like, but please don't do so until late november as I won't be checking my InReach until then. If you send me a message remember to sign-off with your name, my InReach doesn't have contact cards and I don't want to mix you up! Also in Antarctica we run on NZ time, so my messages may come at odd times.

Meanwhile, I'm just starting my pre-quarantine distancing today and desperately trying to pack all the warm stuff I own! 

I'll miss you all this winter, and I'll definitely be thinking of you all as I celebrate Thanksgiving/Christmas/New Years in a tent on the bottom of the world!

A fun update, you can send me mail! You can address letters/postcards (probably not packages) to:


[Participant's Name]
Grantee, C-446
PSC 769 Box 700
APO AP 96599-9998
Regular postage is fine. It goes through military mail.

I think it'll probably take about a month to get down there, and from a friend's experience it seems like a fair amount of letters go missing, so maybe take a photo before sending it if you want to be sure I see what you wrote!

## October 24 2021

After almost 20 days of quarantine and travel, it finally feels like we're almost there! Today we checked out of NZ mandatory quarantine, and are now in USAP (United States Antarctic Program) managed isolation until we fly out to Antarctica tomorrow morning (hopefully!). Our last to-do was to get our Extreme Cold Weather (ECW) clothing from USAP headquarters in Christchurch. That featured trying on many sizes of all items of clothing, including the famous "Big Red" which you can see consuming me alive below. (that's a size medium). I was sure to grab plenty of gloves and mittens as well! We will have to wear all this clothing on the flight tomorrow, so it will probably be a warm flight. This means we must board the plane WEARING insulated pants, "Big Red" parka, winter boots, gloves, warm hat, and ski goggles! I'm told people usually take some items off once they find their seats thankfully. They require this to ensure that everyone doesn't forget any pieces of clothing, and to make sure we are all prepared in case of a less than ideal landing or bad weather when we off-board from the plane. 


I'm excited to finally be traveling anywhere outside my hotel room after the last 20 days, and especially excited to finally almost be in McMurdo! We've additionally started to go over our field detailed plan with our mountaineers for how we will manage our science and safety objectives for the actual field season. Finalizing this plan and getting all the appropriate approvals is our first task to do in McMurdo once we land, so I'm glad we're starting this early. 


Hopefully I'll be able to send email and photo updates pretty soon after I land in Mcmurdo! I'll certainly send an InReach message when we arrive. I will also start checking my InReach more often now, so you can feel free to either message me there or via email for the next month or so.


Missing you all, and sending my love from (almost) the bottom of the world!
-Paul
