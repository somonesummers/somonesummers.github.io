### Running, Biking, and Other Long Activities 
Since about 14 I've always had some endurance hobby keeping me busy and sane. Recently it's been more running/jogging/shuffling.

### Climbing, Skiing, and Other Outdoor Activities 
I also enjoy more technical outdoor activities, mostly as a way to explore even more places in the mountains.

### Sewing, Ceramics, and Other Creative Hobbies
Everyone needs a few indoor hobbies as well, and I use this time to express my more creative side making packs, bags, mugs and editing photos.
