I was a part of the 2023-2024 TIME expedition to Thwaites Glacier, where we completed the final year of fieldwork for the TIME project, a part of the larger International Thwaites Glacier Collaboration. I worked most closely with Daniel (Danny) May, another graduate student at Stanford University who is developing a Bistatic Radar system using the pRES system and a fiber optic transmission cable enabling up to 4 km off sets between the transmitter and receiver. We installed 7 km of fiber optic cable and completed 8 CMP surveys across the Eastern Shear Margin of Thwaites Glacier. This survey was colocated with a comprehensive 3D seismic survey of 1000 nodes and 671 sources also done by the TIME team. 

While transiting through McMurdo station, Danny I also able to do 5 CMP surveys at Eastwind glacier and the McMurdo Ice Shelf. We were able to survey floating ice, grounded ice, and the brine layer.
