## Roaming the Red Rims
Paul Summers
Location: Grand Canyon, AZ
Nov 5 2022

Once upon a dark, cold November morning, I began a slow and careful dance down the Bright Angel Trail. After the first 8 miles of descending in darkness, I reached the river at sunrise and  witnessed an incredible explosion of colors around me and was in total awe of the grand scale of the canyon that I was finally seeing in full daylight. Continuing up the north rim, I gained new appreciation for the vertical scale, finding snow and freezing temps on the uppermost sections of trail. The journey down was a slow one for me, never a speedy descender, but provided ample chances to chat and enjoy the company of similarly minded runners enjoying the shoulder season conditions. The way home included much needed, and soul nourishing, coffee and chips at Phantom Ranch. Then began the endless stairs of South Kaibab, racing the sun home and topping out to a beautiful sunset.
