I am a PhD Candidate in Geophysics at the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability. I am also a Bay Area local, growing up in Palo Alto. In my research I use numerical modeling to understand the mechanics of Glaciers, specifically Antarctic Glaciers and their lateral boundaries. I discovered my passion for exploring and understanding the natural world when I was young through hiking day trips and backpacking at summers camp and through scouting. In high school, I was drawn to math and physics and how these subjects could be used to explain the dynamics of the world around me. In undergrad, I continued my journey with a BS in Physics, but also applied this physics tool set to the natural world, earning a MA in geophysics. 

After undergrad, I took 4 years away from school to work in Tech in San Francisco, before ultimately hearing the call to return to school for my PhD, particularly motivated to study glaciology and the rapidly changing cryosphere. I was drawn to Jenny Suckale's group at Stanford for her process-based, physical modeling approach, and strong collaborative approach to working with local communities to ensure our science is as impactful as possible. 

I hope to continue my career as an educator, aiming to provide accessible, engaging and enjoyable learning opportunities to students. I have developed and practiced this through teaching assistant-ships in Geophysics, teaching apprenticeships in the Stanford Outdoor Adventure program, and through engaging with the Stanford Center for Teaching and Learning.
