### BIOEN 3900:  Biosignals Analysis
Sophomore and junior level course in signal processing and analysis with biomedical applications.

**Teaching Assistant, with Edward Hsu: Spring 2011**<br />
Graded, held office hours, held recitation.

### Teaching Evaluations
Teaching evaluations for EE102A (Signal and Sytems at Stanford) are available since Summer 2015.  Earlier course evaluations are unfortunately unavailable as Stanford revamped their evaluation system.

Evaluations when I was primary instructor: [2015 scores](assets/documents/teaching_evals/EE102A-2014-2015_Summer-Ratings_Summary.pdf),
