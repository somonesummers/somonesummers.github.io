Instructed a group of 34 mostly undergraduate students on glacier dynamics and ice ocean interactions as a part of a multi-week expedition focused on earth science, mountaineering and wilderness skills on an expedition across the Juneau Ice Field. I worked with a team of 7 students on a project monitoring the upper Vaughan Lewis glacier using tiltmeters, GPS, and seismometers to investigate daily fluctuations in ice flow. I additionally led multiple formal lectures and workshops on glaciology and sewing.
